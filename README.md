# Adblocker Detector
Here, I have designed a AdBlocker detector using Html, Css and JavaScrip to detect if browser have an Adblocker.

When websites detect you're using an ad-blocker, they execute anti-adblocking scripts. Those scripts freeze a page and display you a pop-up demanding to whitelist a website, ruin the way a page is displayed, and make it impossible to finish reading a post until you disable your ad-blocker.
